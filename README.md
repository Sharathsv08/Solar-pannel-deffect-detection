# Solar-pannel-deffect-detection

The dataset comprises 200 images of Solar Panels taken using IR camera
which are annotated using Semantic Segmentation Annotation into 4
categories:  
a. ByPass Diode (BP)  
b. Dark Hot Spot (DHS)  
c. Light Hot Spot (LHS)  
d. Normal Panel

ii)  

The repository consists of the data set which has images along with the corresponding annotations  
the repository mainly consists of 2 files
