# Solar-pannel-deffect-detection

The dataset comprises 200 images of Solar Panels taken using IR camera
which are annotated using Semantic Segmentation Annotation into 4
categories:  
a. ByPass Diode (BP)  
b. Dark Hot Spot (DHS)  
c. Light Hot Spot (LHS)  
d. Normal Panel  

The annotation has been done using Dataloop which is used for FCN  
Annoations done using Roboflow is used for SegFormer the below link directs to the roboflow annotations  
https://app.roboflow.com/sharath-nwlng/solar-cell-defect-detection-using-semantic-segmentation/6

The semantic segmentation task has been attempted using two models  
i)FCN  
ii)SegFormer  

The repository consists of the data set which has images along with the corresponding annotations    
The repository also consists of 2 files  
i)FCN - semantic segmenation using FCN  
ii)SegFormer
