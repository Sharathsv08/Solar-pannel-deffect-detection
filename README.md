The dataset comprises 200 images of Solar Panels taken using IR camera
which are annotated using Semantic Segmentation Annotation into 4
categories:  
a. ByPass Diode (BP)  
b. Dark Hot Spot (DHS)

i)FCN  
ii)SegFormer  

The repository consists of the data set which has images along with the corresponding annotations    
The repository also consists of 2 files
